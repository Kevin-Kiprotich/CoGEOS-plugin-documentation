Welcome to CoGEOS Plugin documentation!
=========================================
   The CoGEOS plugin represents a cutting-edge operational tool that leverages remotely sensed data to precisely delineate shorelines and provide essential insights into shoreline dynamics. This innovative technology seamlessly integrates both optical and radar imagery, offering a comprehensive perspective on coastal environments. By employing these two complementary sources of data, it not only accurately identifies shoreline positions but also quantifies the extent of shoreline changes over time. This capability makes the CoGEOS plugin invaluable for a wide range of applications, from monitoring coastal erosion and land-water interface alterations to supporting the management of critical coastal zones and enhancing our understanding of the dynamic interactions between the land and the sea.
